  	<p>Anderson Holderness has strong memories of the beach where he grew up. 
  	Approximately 80% of his dreams are located in and around a dream version of 
  	Wilmington, North Carolina. The dreams are haunting, violent, humorous, or all three.</p>
  	<p>Once, Anderson saw a killer whale surge from the surf, bite a man's leg, and drag 
  	him back into the sea. Another time Anderson had a buffalo for a pet dog, 
  	and they played frisbee on the beach all day long&mdash;every so often he 
  	remembers its sturdy head and its sandy, matted fur. Another time he was sloshing 
  	around in ankle deep water when a bear attacked him. As he fought back, the bear 
  	disintegrated in his hands, into a blanket he clutched as he woke. </p>
    <p>Dreams are emotional geography. Anderson enjoys probing the vast, undulating 
    world of his subconscious, and mapping and charting where his visions take him.</p>
